## About this episode

In this episode of ReactU we will be building a party creation wizard to accompany our role playing game. The wizard consists of several screens where you pick a class, give the character a name and a bio, and roll their attributes, and then that flow loops until all 4 part characters are created.

You can find the screencast on youtube here: https://youtu.be/lN_mohRn3Vc
